## Prerequisites
      
- [Node.js](http://es6-features.org)


## Commands
- `npm install` - Install all the npm packages
- `npm start` - start the dev server

## How to Run
Update the 'host' property in webpack.dev.js to the IP address of the machine, in-order to run the application from an external mobile device, instead of just localhost.
